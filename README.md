TinyTorch is a *library* designed for learning the internal
concepts underlying deep learning systems for machine learning engineers .  

It is a pure Python
re-implementation of the [Torch](http://www.pytorch.org) API
designed to be simple, easy-to-read, tested, and incremental. The
final library can run Torch code. 

Topics covered:

* Basic Neural Networks and Modules
* Autodifferentiation for Scalars
* Tensors, Views, and Strides
* Parallel Tensor Operations
* GPU / CUDA Programming in NUMBA
* Convolutions and Pooling
* Advanced NN Functions
